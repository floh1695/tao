      <p>A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: What sort of programmers work for other companies?

He has gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code. He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident. Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.</q></p>

      <p>There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the warlord of Wu. The warlord asked the programmer: <q>Which is easier to design: an accounting package or an operating system?</q></p>
      <p><q>An operating system,</q> replied the programmer.</p>
      <p>The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief. <q>Surely an accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system,</q> he said.</p>
      <p><q>Not so,</q> said the programmer, <q>When designing an accounting package, the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to the tax laws. By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside appearances. When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas. This is why an operating system is easier to design.</q></p>

When I first began to program, I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three years, I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle. My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct. In short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of the work fill my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off.</q></p>
